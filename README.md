To publish a new production version:
* Create a PR to the `Alpha` branch with your changes. This will act as a "staging" branch.
* When ready to publish a new production version, create a PR from `Alpha` to `master`. The Git Subject should include `[semver:patch|minor|release|skip]` to indicate the type of release.
* On merge, the release will be published to the orb registry automatically.
